## Common Pitfalls Across All 3 Blogs (15 Total)

### Blog 7 Pitfalls (5):
1. Testing only happy paths (not error scenarios)
2. Ignoring low-volume issues (severity ≠ frequency)
3. Analytics overwhelm (too many metrics)
4. No feedback loop (users report, nothing changes)
5. Insufficient UAT time (rush in 1-2 days)

### Blog 8 Pitfalls (5):
1. Assuming security is IT's job (business owns agent)
2. Over-restricting access (RBAC too strict)
3. Compliance as afterthought (engage legal early)
4. Ignoring audit logs (enabled but never reviewed)
5. No governance enforcement (policies on paper only)

### Blog 9 Pitfalls (5):
1. Deploying to all channels too quickly (phased rollout better)
2. Same experience across all channels (mobile needs optimization)
3. No access control between channels (public web ≠ internal Teams)
4. Ignoring channel-specific analytics (optimize each independently)
5. Poor mobile discovery (users don't know it exists)

---

## Key Takeaways by Blog

### Blog 7: Testing & Monitoring
1. Testing is non-negotiable (2 days testing prevents 2 weeks problems)
2. UAT provides real-world validation (5-10 users find issues you missed)
3. Analytics guide optimization (Big 3: CSAT, Resolution, Escalation)
4. Conversation transcripts are goldmines (20/week reveal patterns)
5. A/B testing reduces guesswork (data-driven decisions)
6. Continuous improvement is a habit (weekly 1-hour ritual)
7. Quality scorecards enforce standards (80+ = production-ready)

### Blog 8: Security, Compliance, Governance
1. Security is foundational (30 min setup prevents $400K+ breaches)
2. Azure AD authentication is table stakes (no production without it)
3. RBAC protects sensitive data (Finance data for Finance team only)
4. DLP prevents leaks (block credit cards, SSNs before shared)
5. Compliance is achievable (checklists make GDPR/HIPAA manageable)
6. Audit logs are legal protection (prove what happened, when, who)
7. Governance enables scale (can't manage 100 agents without it)

### Blog 9: Multi-Channel Deployment
1. Build once, deploy everywhere (same agent, 3 channels)
2. Channel-specific optimization (adaptive cards, concise mobile)
3. Access control is critical (public web ≠ internal Teams)
4. Multi-channel analytics (track by channel, optimize independently)
5. Phased rollout (Teams → web → mobile)
6. 5x ROI with multi-channel (same cost, 5x reach)
7. Mobile matters (60%+ users on mobile)
