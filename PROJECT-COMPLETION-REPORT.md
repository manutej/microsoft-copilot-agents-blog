## Expected Return on Investment

### Business Value Projection (90 Days Post-Launch)

**Target Metrics** (from specification):
- 100+ agent deployments
- 500+ business users trained
- $500K+ documented business value
- 10+ enterprise adoptions

**Conservative ROI Calculation**:

Assuming **50 agent deployments** in 90 days (50% of target):
- Average time saved per agent: 20 hours/month
- Average hourly rate: $35/hour
- Monthly value per agent: 20 hrs × $35 = $700
- Total monthly value: 50 agents × $700 = **$35,000/month**
- Total 90-day value: **$105,000**

**ROI**: ($105,000 - $15,000) / $15,000 = **600% in 90 days**

**Full Target ROI** (100 deployments):
- Total 90-day value: **$210,000**
